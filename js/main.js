// general scripts or initialization code (if needed...)

/* GUIDELINES: 
    - If you need to run some code that ties everything together or initializes multiple components, you can do so in main.js.
    - Place script just before </body> (it's a good practice apparently)
    - Using defer ensures scripts run after the HTML is parsed (ex: <script src=/js/menu.js defer></script)
    - Order is preserved with defer, so dependencies load properly
