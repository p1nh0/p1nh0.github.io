## How to Add Content

### 1. Add a Work
- Create a new HTML file in `/works/`, follow `_example-work.html` as template.
- Include `<meta>` description and set a proper `<title>`.
- Preview: image, title, and short description should go at top.
- Works are loaded dynamically into `works.html` via JS.

### 2. Add Music
- Add Bandcamp/Soundcloud embed into `music.html`.
- Wrap in `<div class="bandcamp-embed">...</div>` for consistency.

### 3. Add Free Stuff
- Add file under `/freestuff/` matching one of the categories.
- Link will auto-work from `freestuff.html`.

### 4. Add Teaching
- Add content to `teaching.html` as text or embedded media.

## Tips
- Keep image sizes optimized (e.g. 400x300 for previews).
- Use only `.jpg` or `.webp` for full compatibility.
- Maintain consistent metadata for SEO.
