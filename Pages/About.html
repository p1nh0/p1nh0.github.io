			<p id="About" class="Text">
				I am a composer/musician, sound artist and creative coder whose work converges sound, media and interaction.

				I also have been lecturing workshops and talks on themes such as interactive music and the development of novel musical instruments at conferences, universities and other venues such as KISMIF 2014 (Keep it Simple Make it Fast - Underground Music Scenes and DIY Cultures conference) at Faculty of Arts of the University of Porto, FIMP 2014 (Porto International Puppet Festival) and Casa da M&uacutesica.

				I'm also an open-source and DIY enthusiast, often building instruments and musical software for my own performances.
